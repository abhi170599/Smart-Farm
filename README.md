# Smart-Farm
Smart predictions can be an aid to the farmers for planing their crops efficiently.

The growing menace of over production and wastage of agricultural products can be minimized by a well planned  supply and demand chain.
This can be achieved through Artificial Intelligence.

This project is aimed at development of a website where farmers can get the expected demands , MSP and production of different crops over different regions thus giving a perspective to plan accordingly.

The predictions  on demand are made using LSTMs on the basis of rainfall patterns , GDP and exchange rate
